## User guide

Basic usage:

- create a directory `mock-server`
- place some handler files in it (read below for how to write them)
- run `mock-server`

### CLI options

- `root`: mock server root directory, defaults to `mock-server`
- `port`: mock server port, defaults to `3456`
- `delay`: milliseconds to delay all responses by, defaults to 0
- `watch`: boolean flag, makes the server reload on file changes
- `serveConfig`: boolean flag, serves a config script at `/app-config.js`. The
  script is generated by
  [@staticdeploy/app-config](https://github.com/staticdeploy/app-config) from
  environment variables and - if a `.env` file il present - variables defined in
  it
- `require`: require a module before startup, can be used multiple times
- `useHttps`: boolean flag, makes `mock-server` serve requests via https. When
  enabled `mock-server` generates a self signed certificate that your borswer
  needs to trust before being able to make API calls to the server. To trust the
  certificate, visit https://localhost:3456 and dismiss the security warning
- `middleware`: path to a file exporting an array of express middleware. The
  path should be relative to the mock server root directory. Defaults to
  `middleware.js`

### Writing handler files

Handler files are files whose basename matches an http method:
`mock-server/get.js`, `mock-server/users/post.js` etc.

Handler files export an [express](http://expressjs.com) route handler:

```js
// mock-server/get.js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("OK");
};
```

The function exported by a handler file is registered as the handler for the
route whose path matches the handler file's path relative to the `mock-server`
directory, and whose method matches the handler file's name. Examples:

- the function exported by `mock-server/get.js` is registered as the handler for
  route `GET /`
- the function exported by `mock-server/users/post.js` is registered as the
  handler for route `POST /users`

You can also use route params:

- the function exported by `mock-server/users/{userId}/get.js` is registered as
  the handler for route `GET /users/:userId`

Which you can access as you would in express:

```js
// mock-server/users/{userId}/get.js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params.userId);
  res.status(200).send(`userId: ${req.params.userId}`);
};
```

> Note: the path syntax for parametric routes is `.../{param}/...` instead of
> `.../:param/...` because the latter path is not valid for some filesystems (eg
> NTFS)

Request bodies are parsed according to their mime-type:

- **application/json**: `req.body` is an object, the parsed json body
- **text/\***: `req.body` is as string, the body
- **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**: `req.body` is an object, the parsed
  urlencoded body
- **\*/\***: `req.body` is a buffer, the raw body

### Delaying responses

`mock-server` adds a `delay` method to the express response object which you can
use to delay individual responses:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res
    // Delay in milliseconds
    .delay(1000)
    .status(200)
    .send("Delayed response");
};
```

### Validating requests and responses

Read the [validation guide](validation.md) to learn how to validate requests
received by the mock-server, as well as responses generated by it.
