## User guide

Basic usage:

* create a directory `mock-server`
* place some handler files in it (read below for how to write them)
* run `mock-server`

### CLI options

* `root`: mock server root directory, defaults to `mock-server`
* `port`: mock server port, defaults to `3456`
* `delay`: milliseconds to delay responses by, defaults to 0
* `watch`: boolean flag, makes the server reload on file changes
* `serveConfig`: boolean flag, serves a config script at `/app-config.js`. The
  script is generated by
  [app-server](https://github.com/staticdeploy/app-server) from environment
  variables. Requires installing `@staticdeploy/app-server`, being a peer
  dependency of `@staticdeploy/mock-server`
* `require`: require a module before startup, can be used multiple times
* `useHttps`: boolean flag, makes `mock-server` serve requests via https. When
  enabled `mock-server` generates a self signed certificate that your borswer
  needs to trust before being able to make API calls to the server. To trust the
  certificate, visit https://localhost:3456 and dismiss the security warning

### Writing handler files

Handler files are files whose basename matches an http method:
`mock-server/get.js`, `mock-server/users/post.js` etc.

Handler files export an [express](http://expressjs.com) route handler:

```js
// mock-server/get.js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send("OK");
};
```

The function exported by a handler file is registered as the handler for the
route whose path matches the handler file's path relative to the `mock-server`
directory, and whose method matches the handler file's name. Examples:

* the function exported by `mock-server/get.js` is registered as the handler for
  route `GET /`
* the function exported by `mock-server/users/post.js` is registered as the
  handler for route `POST /users`

You can also use route params:

* the function exported by `mock-server/users/{userId}/get.js` is registered as
  the handler for route `GET /users/:userId`

Which you can access as you would in express:

```js
// mock-server/users/{userId}/get.js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.params.userId);
    res.status(200).send(`userId: ${req.params.userId}`);
};
```

> Note: the path syntax for parametric routes is `.../{param}/...` instead of
> `.../:param/...` because the latter path is not valid for some filesystems (eg
> NTFS)

Request bodies are parsed according to their mime-type:

* **application/json**: `req.body` is an object, the parsed json body
* **text/\***: `req.body` is as string, the body
* **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**: `req.body` is an object, the parsed
  urlencoded body
* **\*/\***: `req.body` is a buffer, the raw body
